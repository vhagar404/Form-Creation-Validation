# Fetching Data From an API – User List Display

This project demonstrates how to fetch user data asynchronously from a public API and display it on a webpage.  
It is part of the **Form-Creation-Validation** repository.

## 📌 Objective
Create a simple webpage that:
- Fetches user data from an API asynchronously  
- Displays each user’s name in a styled list  
- Handles errors gracefully  

Public API used:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. JavaScript fetches data asynchronously
An async function named `fetchUserData()` sends a request to the API using `fetch()`.

### 2. Data is converted to JSON
The API response is parsed with:
```js
await response.json();
3. Names are displayed in a list
🖼 Expected Output

A clean list of user names similar to:

Leanne Graham

Ervin Howell

Clementine Bauch

Patricia Lebsack

...

📜 License

This project is for learning and practice under ALX.

Each user’s name is placed inside a <li> element, which is inserted in a <ul>.

4. Error handling

If something goes wrong, a message is displayed:
Failed to load user data.
5. Runs on page load
The script executes automatically after the DOM is fully loaded:
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', fetchUserData);
